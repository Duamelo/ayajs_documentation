When you instantiate aya from the Init class, a set of useful attributes is made available to customize the use of the library.
The table below shows the main attributes: their names and descriptions.
## aya.Init(width = 1343, height = 1343)

<b>Specification : </b>  The init class is the entry point of aya. Its constructor takes two parameters: the width and height of the svg.


| Attributes's name             | Description
| :-------------:               |:-------------:|
| width                         | Width of svg. |
| height                        | Height of svg.     |
| svg                           | Represents the svg document in which we draw all the shapes created from the current instantiation of aya.|
| config                        | Allows you to access the basic configurations of aya.      |
| events                        | Allows to access the events defined by aya and to apply them to the forms.|
| box                           | This is the object component representing the default grid of aya.      |
